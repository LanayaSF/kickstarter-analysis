
# Analyzing Kickstarter Campaign Fundraiser Success in Relation to Goals and Campaign Start Date 

## Project Overview

### Purpose

Louise is a performance arts enthusiast who used grassroots methods to produce her play, “Fever”. She launched a Kickstarter campaign in the US to collect pledges, starting from June 2016 and ending within a month. Her goal was to collect $2,885, however her campaign failed as she was only able to collect $2,485. Louise wants to know how other campaigns performed in relation to launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

We looked at campaign outcomes (successful, failed, or canceled) for theater campaigns based on the date that the campaign was launched, across years 2009 to 2017. Referencing our first chart, “Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date”, we can see that the greatest number of theater Kickstarter campaigns were launched in May and June, and of those, May had the highest number of successful campaigns across all other months, from 2009 to 2017. December had the least number of successful theater campaigns. If we quickly scan the data, we can see that the ratio of successful campaigns to failed is greater in May and June, compared to December, where there were almost an equal number of successful and failed campaigns. There may be seasonality around theater watching, which could influence the amount of support given to theater campaigns at the start of summer compared to winter. There was no significant trend seen among canceled campaigns, which were all relatively low across months. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

We looked at the percent of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns of plays (a subset of theaters), based on the dollar goal amount set in the campaign. Looking at the “Outcomes Based on Goals” chart, we can see that generally, as the goal amount increased, the percent successful decreased, and the percent failed increased (with the exception of goal amounts in between $35,000-$44,999, more on that below). We can infer that the lower the goal amount, the greater the likelihood that the campaign will be successful, conversely, the higher the goal amount, the greater the likelihood that the campaign will fail. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

### Conclusions

Launch Date: We recommend launching theater Kickstarter campaigns in May or June. However, if that is not possible, we recommend not launching the campaign from October to December, as those campaigns had gad a greater probability of failing. 

Goals: We recommend Louise to keep the goal for her play low, less than $5000 to have the highest likelihood of succeeding. 

### Data Limitations

All dollar amounts should be standardized to one single currency, since goal and pledged are key metrics. There are also some outliers for campaign goals and there is generally greater spread around mean. Those campaigns are unrealistically high for Kickstarter audience and should be removed. 

### Future Analysis Opportunities

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? There are many opportunities to further drill down on the data to gain more insights. Successful vs Failed doesn’t tell us much about the campaign success compared to Percentage Funded, Average Donation, and Number of Backers. Also length of campaign is also useful information, as longer campaigns may have more opportunity to generate pledges. There may be differences in countries that campaigns were held in, years, and across Parent and Subcategories. Some years might have had overall greater pledges than others, and similarly with countries.
